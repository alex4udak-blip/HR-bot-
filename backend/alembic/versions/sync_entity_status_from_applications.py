"""Sync Entity.status from VacancyApplication.stage

This migration fixes data inconsistency where Entity.status was out of sync
with VacancyApplication.stage. The root cause was bidirectional sync that
updated ALL applications when Entity.status changed.

The fix:
1. Entity.status no longer syncs TO VacancyApplication.stage
2. VacancyApplication.stage still syncs TO Entity.status (Kanban is source of truth)
3. This migration syncs existing data: sets Entity.status based on the "best" stage
   from all VacancyApplications (highest progress that isn't rejected)
