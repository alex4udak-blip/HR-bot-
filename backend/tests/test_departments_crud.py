"""
Comprehensive unit tests for department CRUD operations.

Tests cover:
- All CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Department member management (add, remove, update roles)
- Role hierarchy and permissions (lead, sub_admin, member)
- Department hierarchy (parent/child relationships)
- Edge cases and error handling
- Cross-organization isolation
- Nested hierarchies and complex scenarios
- Department statistics
- Cross-department access control
